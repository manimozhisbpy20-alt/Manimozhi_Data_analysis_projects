# Swiggy Sales Analysis – SQL Project

This end-to-end SQL analytics project analyzes Swiggy food delivery data across states, cities, locations, restaurants, categories, and dishes.
The project covers data cleaning, dimensional modelling (Star Schema), KPI creation, and business insights used to understand customer behaviour and restaurant performance.


#BUSINESS OBJECTIVES

Swiggy wants to improve decision-making by understanding:

1. What cities and states generate the most revenue
2. Which cuisines and restaurants perform best
3. How customers spend across different price ranges
4. What dishes receive the highest/lowest ratings
5. Sales trends across months, quarters & weekdays

This project provides SQL-driven insights based on real-world business needs.
